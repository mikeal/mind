## Sequential Appearance of Six Subtle Doors

次釋「第二、次第相生六妙門」者，次第相生入道之階梯也。若於欲界中巧行六法，第六淨心成就，即發三乘無漏，況復具足諸禪三昧？


次釋「第二、次第相生六妙門」者，
Next explaining "second, sequential appearance of Six Subtle Doors,"

次第相生入道之階梯也。
sequentially co-arising entries into the path.

若於欲界中巧行六法，
If in the realm of desire one practices six dharmas,

第六淨心成就，
the sixth [practice of] purifying the mind is accomplished,

即發三乘無漏，
immediately arouse Three Vehicles free from outflows (āsrava),

況復具足諸禪三昧？
how much more fully equipped with all dhyāna and samādhi?

### Counting (gaṇanā)

此即與前有異。所以者何？如數有二種：一者修數，二者證數。修數者，行者調和氣息，不澁不滑，安詳徐數，從一至十，攝心在數，不令馳散，是名修數。證數者，覺心任運，從一至十，不加功力，心住息緣，覺息虛微，心相漸細。

此即與前有異。
This is different from the previous.

所以者何？
Why is this so?

如數有二種：
Because there are two kinds of counting (gaṇanā):

一者修數，
the first is practicing counting (gaṇanā),

二者證數。
the second is confirming counting (gaṇanā).

修數者，
One who practices counting (gaṇanā),

行者調和氣息，
practices harmonious breathing patterns,

不澁不滑，
neither rough nor slick,

安詳徐數，
calm favorable gentle counting,

從一至十，
from one to ten,

攝心在數，
focus mind in counting,

不令馳散，
not distracted or scattered,

是名修數。
this is called practicing counting.

證數者，覺心任運，
The confirmation of counting, is awakened mind effortlessly moving,

從一至十，
from one to ten,

不加功力，
without force of effort,

心住息緣，
mind abiding on breath dependence,

覺息虛微，
realizing subtle emptiness of breath,

心相漸細。
appearances of mind become progressively subtle.

### Following (anugamaḥ)

患數為麁，意不欲數。爾時行者應當放數修隨。隨亦有二：一者修隨，二者證隨。修隨者，捨前數法，一心依隨息之出入，攝心緣息，知息入出，心住息緣，無分散意。是名修隨。證隨者，心既微細，安靜不亂，覺息長短，遍身入出，心息任運相依，意慮恬然凝靜。

患數為麁，意不欲數。
Suffering from coarse counting, mind does not desire counting.

爾時行者應當放數修隨。
At such a time practioners should release counting to practice following.

隨亦有二
Following also has two aspects:

一者修隨，
the first is practicing following (anugamaḥ),

二者證隨。
the second is confirming following (anugamaḥ).

修隨者，捨前數法，一心依隨息之出入，
Following (anugamaḥ) practitioners, abandon previous counting methods, single-mindedly depend on following breath entering and exiting,

攝心緣息，知息入出，心住息緣，無分散意。
focus mind on breath dependence, aware of breath entering and exiting, mind abides on breath dependence, without scattered thoughts.

是名修隨。
This is called practicing following.

證隨者，心既微細，安靜不亂，
Confirming following, mind already very subtle, peaceful and not distracted,

覺息長短，遍身入出，
aware of breath being long or short, pervading every body entering and exiting,

心息任運相依，意慮恬然凝靜。
mind breath naturally interdepend upon one another, relective thought settles into serene stillness.

### Resting (śamatha)

覺隨為麁，心厭欲捨，如人疲極欲眠，不樂眾務。爾時行者應當捨隨修止。止亦有二：一者修止，二者證止。修止者，息諸緣慮，不念數隨，凝寂其心，是名修止。證止者，覺身心泯然入定，不見內外相貌，定法持心，任運不動。

覺隨為麁，心厭欲捨，如人疲極欲眠，不樂眾務。
Confirming following (anugamaḥ) is coarse, mind weary desires abandonment, like a person exhausted and desiring to sleep, not enjoying many tasks.

爾時行者應當捨隨修止。
At such a time, practitioners should abandon following and practice resting (śamatha).

止亦有二：一者修止，二者證止。
Resting also has two aspects: the first is practicing resting (śamatha), and the second is realising resting (śamatha).

修止者，息諸緣慮，不念數隨，凝寂其心，是名修止。
Practicing resting (śamatha) involves ceasing all dependent thoughts, not thinking of counting or following, making the mind calm and tranquil. This is called practicing resting.

證止者，覺身心泯然入定，不見內外相貌，定法持心，任運不動。
Realising resting (śamatha) involves sensing the body and mind completely merge in samadhi, not perceiving inner or outer forms, with the samadhi principle (dharma) sustaining the mind, naturally unmoving.

### Intuiting (vipaśyanā)

行者是時即作是念：「今此三昧雖復無為寂靜、安隱快樂，而無惠方便，不能破壞生死。」復作是念：「今此定者，皆屬因緣，陰界入法和合而有，虛誑不實。我今不見不覺，應須照了。」作是念已，即不著止，起觀分別。觀亦有二：一者修觀，二者證觀。修觀者，於定心中以惠分別，觀於微細出入息相，如空中風；皮、肉、筋、骨……三十六物，如芭蕉不實；心識無常剎那不住；無有我、人。身、受、心、法皆無自性。不得人法，定何所依？是名修觀。證觀者，如是觀時，覺息出入遍諸毛孔，心眼開明，徹見三十六物及諸虫戶，內外不淨，剎那變易，心生悲喜，得四念處，破四顛倒，是名證觀。=

行者是時即作是念：
Practitioners at this time think:

「今此三昧雖復無為寂靜、安隱快樂，
"This samadhi although not conditioned is tranquil, peacefully blissful,

而無惠方便，
is without wisdom (prajna) and skillful means (upaya),

不能破壞生死。」
cannot destroy birth and death."

復作是念：
Continue thinking:

「今此定者，皆屬因緣，陰界入法和合而有，虛誑不實。我今不見不覺，應須照了。」
"This calmness, all depend on causes and conditions, the union of the aggregates (skandhas) and sense bases (dhatus), unreal appearances. Now I do not see and do not perceive, must clearly illuminate."

作是念已，
Having thought thus,

即不著止，起觀分別。
promptly unattached resting (śamatha), intuiting (vipaśyanā) differentiation arises.

觀亦有二：
Intuiting (vipaśyanā) also has two aspects:

一者修觀，
First, practicing intuiting,

二者證觀。
Second, realizing intuiting.

修觀者，
Practicing intuiting (vipaśyanā),

於定心中以惠分別，
in samadhi mind differentiates with wisdom (prajna),

觀於微細出入息相，如空中風；
intuition into subtle in-and-out breath (prāṇa), like wind in air;

皮、肉、筋、骨……三十六物，如芭蕉不實；
skin, flesh, sinew, bone... the thirty-six elements, like a hollow banana tree;

心識無常剎那不住；
mind and consciousness impermanent, ceaselessly changing every moment;

無有我、人。
No self, no person.

身、受、心、法皆無自性。
Body, feeling, mind, dharmas all devoid of intrinsic nature (niḥsvabhāva).

不得人法，定何所依？
Not finding any person or dharma, what can samadhi depend on?

是名修觀。
This is called practicing intuiting.

證觀者，
Realizing intuiting (vipaśyanā),

如是觀時，
when intuiting thus,

覺息出入遍諸毛孔，
feel breath (prāṇa) entering and exiting through all pores,

心眼開明，
mind's eye illuminates,

徹見三十六物及諸虫戶，
thoroughly sees the thirty-six elements and various beings,

內外不淨，
internally and externally impure,

剎那變易，
momentary changes,

心生悲喜，
mind generates compassion and joy,

得四念處，
attains Four Foundations of Mindfulness,

破四顛倒，
destroys the Four Inversions (viparyāsa),

是名證觀。
This is called realizing intuiting (vipaśyanā).

### Turning (vivartanā)

觀相既發，心緣觀境，分別破折，覺念流動，非真實道。爾時應當捨觀修還。還亦有二：一者修還，二者證還。修還者，既知觀從心生，若從折境，此即不會本源。應當反觀觀心，此觀心者，從何而生？為從觀心生？為從非觀心生？若從觀心生，即已有觀，今實不爾。所以者何？數、隨、止等三法中，未有即觀故。若從不觀心生，不觀心為滅生？為不滅生？若不滅生，即二心並。若滅法生，滅法已謝，不能生觀。若言亦滅亦不滅生，乃至非滅非不滅生，皆不可得。當知觀心本自不生，不生故不有，不有故即空，空故無觀心。若無觀心，豈有觀境？境智雙亡，還源之要也，是名修還相。證還相者，心惠開發，不加功力，任運自能破折，反本還源，是名證還。

觀相既發，
When appearances of intuition arise,

心緣觀境，
mind adhere's to objects of observation,

分別破折，覺念流動，非真實道。
differentiating and dividing, thinking and perceiving, this is not the true path.

爾時應當捨觀修還。
At such a time, one should abandon intuiting (vipaśyanā) and practice turning (vivartanā).

還亦有二：一者修還，二者證還。
Turning also has two aspects: one is practicing turning, and the other is realizing turning.

修還者，既知觀從心生，若從折境，此即不會本源。
One practicing turning already knows intuition (vipaśyanā) arises from mind, if arising from an obstructed state, then this does not understand original nature.

應當反觀觀心，
One should invert observation observing mind,

此觀心者，
this observing minder,

從何而生?
from where is it born?

為從非觀心生？
Is it born from not observing mind?

若從觀心生，即已有觀，今實不爾。
If it's born from observing mind, then there is already observation, but thus is not so.

所以者何？
Why is this so?

數、隨、止等三法中，未有即觀故。
In the three practices of counting, following, and resting, there is not yet immediate observation.

若從不觀心生，不觀心為滅生？為不滅生？
If it arises from not observing the mind, does not observing the mind lead to cessation or to non-cessation?

若不滅生，即二心並。
If non-cessation arises, then two minds coexist.

若滅法生，滅法已謝，不能生觀。
If cessation arises, cessation has ended, it cannot give rise to observation.

若言亦滅亦不滅生，乃至非滅非不滅生，皆不可得。
If you say 'also cessation' and 'also not cessation' arise, even up to 'not cessation' and 'not not cessation' arise, all cannot be attained.

當知觀心本自不生，
One should know observing mind originally is not born,

不生故不有，
not born means it does not exist,

不有故即空，
'not exist' means thus empty,

空故無觀心。
empty means no observing mind.

若無觀心，豈有觀境
If no observing mind, how are there realms of observation?

境智雙亡，還源之要也，是名修還相。
When realm and wisdom both vanish, (re)turning to original nature is essential, This is called the practice of turning.

證還相者，
One realizes turning appearances,

心惠開發，
mind wisdom openly develops,

不加功力，
without adding force,

任運自能破折，
letting natural movement break through,

反本還源，
returning to original nature,

是名證還。
this is called realizing turning.

### Purifying (pariśuddhiḥ)

行者當知，若離境智，欲歸無境智，不離境智縛，以隨二邊故。爾時當捨還門，安心淨道。淨亦有二：一者修淨，二者證淨。修淨者，知色淨故，不起妄想分別，受、想、行、識亦復如是。息妄想垢，是名修淨；息分別垢，是名修淨；息取我垢，是名修淨。舉要言之，若能心如本淨，是名修淨；亦不得能修、所修及淨、不淨，是名修淨。證淨者，如是修時，豁然心惠相應，無礙方便任運開發，三昧正受，心無依恃。證淨有二：一者相似證，五方便相似無漏道惠發；二者真實證，苦法忍乃至第九無礙道等真無漏惠發也。三界垢盡，故名證淨。

行者當知，若離境智，欲歸無境智，不離境智縛，以隨二邊故。
Practitioners must know, if separated from realm wisdom, desiring return without realm wisdom, not separated from realm wisdom's constraints, caused by following the two extremes[^2e].

[^2e]: The "two extremes" are **eternalism** (śāśvata-dṛṣṭi), which posits an unchanging, eternal self, and **nihilism** (uccheda-dṛṣṭi), which denies any form of continuity or existence after death.

爾時當捨還門，安心淨道。
At such a time you should abandon the turning door, rest mind on pure path.

淨亦有二：一者修淨，二者證淨。
Purifying (pariśuddhiḥ) also has two aspects: one is practicing purifying, and the other is realizing purifying.

修淨者，
One who practices purifying,

知色淨故，
knows form's pure cause,

不起妄想分別，
not arousing false thoughts descrimintating,

受、想、行、識亦復如是。
feeling, perceiving, forming, and consciousness are also this way.

息妄想垢，是名修淨；
Ceasing false thoughts un-purifying, this is called practicing purifying;

息分別垢，是名修淨；
ceasing descriminating un-purifying, this is called practicing purifying;

息取我垢，是名修淨。
ceasing appropriating self un-purifying, this is called practicing purifying.

舉要言之，若能心如本淨，是名修淨；
In summary, if able to mind as originally pure, this is called practicing purifying;

亦不得能修、所修及淨、不淨，
also not attaining practice, that which is practiced and pure, impure,

是名修淨。
this is called practicing purifying.

證淨者，如是修時，豁然心惠相應，
Realizing purifying, while practicing thus, clear mind and wisdom harmonize,

無礙方便任運開發，
unhindered skillful means (upaya) naturally develop,

三昧正受，心無依恃。
samadhi rightly received, mind without dependence to depend on.

證淨有二：
Realizing purifying has two aspects:

一者相似證，五方便相似無漏道惠發；
The first is approximate realization, skillful means (upaya) approximating a path free from outflows manifesting wisdom;

二者真實證，苦法忍乃至第九無礙道等真無漏惠發也。
The second is true realization, patient endurance of the truth of suffering up to the ninth unobstructed path and so on truly free from outflows manifesting wisdom realized.

三界垢盡，故名證淨。
Defilements of the three realms exhausted, so it is called realizing purifying.

復次，觀眾生空，故名為觀；觀實法空，故名為還；觀平等空，故名為淨。復次，空三昧相應，故名為觀；無相三昧相應，故名為還；無作三昧相應，故名為淨。復次，一切外觀名為觀；一切內觀名為還；一切非內非外觀名為淨。故先尼梵志言：「非內觀故，得是智惠；非外觀故，得是智惠；非內外觀故，得是智惠；亦不無觀故，得是智惠也。」

復次，觀眾生空，故名為觀；
Next, observing beings as empty, thus called "observing" (vipaśyanā);

觀實法空，故名為還；
observing true dharmas as empty, thus called "turning" (vivartanā);

觀平等空，故名為淨。
observing equality as empty, thus called "purifying" (pariśuddhiḥ).

復次，空三昧相應，故名為觀；
Next, corresponding to the emptiness samādhi, thus called "observing";

無相三昧相應，故名為還；
corresponding to the signless samādhi, thus called "turning";

無作三昧相應，故名為淨。
corresponding to the wishless samādhi, thus called "purifying".

復次，一切外觀名為觀；
Next, all external observations are called "observing";

一切內觀名為還；
all internal observations are called "turning";

一切非內非外觀名為淨。
all neither internal nor external observations are called "purifying".

故先尼梵志言：
Therefore, the former ascetic Nivṛtti said:

「非內觀故，得是智惠；
"Not observing internally, thus attaining this wisdom;

非外觀故，得是智惠；
not observing externally, thus attaining this wisdom;

非內外觀故，得是智惠；
not observing internally and externally, thus attaining this wisdom;

亦不無觀故，得是智惠也。」
also not without observing, thus attaining this wisdom."
