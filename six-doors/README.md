## About

Unlike many classic chinese Buddhist texts, this one is not translated from sanksrit, nor is it pretending to be translated from sanskrit as some original chinese texts are. This text is proudly chinese, having been produced by the famed [Zhìyǐ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhiyi), the Great Master of Tiantai Buddhism.

Tiantai Buddhism has a long history not relevant to this manual. It was the first school of Buddhism to become dominant in China, which also makes it the first Buddhism erradicated by the Chinese state, but not the last.

Tiantai Buddhism has many practices and many texts but Zhìyǐ's works standout among them, so much so that his works are referrenced and studied by many other schools of Buddhism, especially east asian schools.

The son of both a Daoist and a Buddhist, [Zhìyǐ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhiyi) is well known for original chinese works that bring the large canon of practices and ideas into a coherent whole that is accessible to the people of china his time. Those works remained accessible even when translated to other languages for over a thousand years.

This text was first introduced to me in the form of Bhikshu Dharmamitra's translation of the text into English. Reading this text was a revelation.

Most students of meditation follow a particular method or lineage, but I have always sought out all methods and knowledge to inform my practice. At times this has been difficult, not knowing how so many different views fit together. When I first read this text, with a mind well conditioned to computers and programming, it was like someone had written a manual for a complete "meditation operating system."

Every teaching, every method I've found before and since fit perfectly into this "operating system." Such is the genius of Zhìyǐ.

This was his gift to the would-be meditators of China in his time, overwhelmed by the many different teachings and practices of Buddhism being translated by different translators at different times. It remains relevant today as we are now overwhelmed by the many different teachings and practices of Buddhism being translated by different translators at different times.

In that way, this text should not be seen as the "correct" translation, apart from the "incorrect" translations, but instead should unify various teachings and translations into a unified practice.

### One Scroll

The original chinese text was written and preserved as a single scroll.

This means that when it was pulled out to be studied it could be hung up and read in a single sitting. This is a common practice in traditional asian buddhism, where a scroll and hung up in a temple or a home for study.

This makes this text unique among Zhìyǐ's works on meditation. Others are more thorough, some are collected from talks, but this was authored with the intention that it be produced and distributed as a single scroll.

This was, and still is, a practice manual.

This means that many teachings are referred to and not explained in detail. In order to make this manual more accessible to modern readers unfamiliar with these teachings, I will include various appendixes that are translations of other classical texts which pre-date this work and discuss the teachings in more detail.

## About the Translation

This translation was assisted by AI but is no means a direct product of AI translation. Far from it. By default, AI translations make the same mistakes human translators do, because that's what they are trained on.

This is a **practice translation**. It was written with practice in mind, it was iterated upon in the course of practice, and it remains arranged for use in practice.

This means the text is translated and arranged in a way that is incredibly faithful to the original text. So faithful that, at times, general readability is sacrificed. As is often the case when translating older languages to newer ones, the original text uses language the allows for many different sorts of meanings and most translators choose one of those meanings to translate. This translation tries to preserve the openness of the original languages instead. In this case, ancient chinese and sanskrit from which many of the key terms are translated or transliterated from.

The result is a "style" that is punchy and direct, sometimes poetic, sometimes robotic. The original puncuation is often preserved intact so that one can see the visual presentation of the original chinese as chinese is a very visual language and this text was written to be hung up and read seated in meditation.
