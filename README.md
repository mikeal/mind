# Mind - a manual

This is a manual about this mind named "Mind."

The root of this manual is a translation of "Six Subtle Dharma Doors," a buddhist mediation manual by the great master 智顗 (Zhìyǐ).

Also included are numerous translations of other works, some partial, some complete. Each serves as explanatory commentary on the root text which refers to many classical buddhist practices and teachings.

The translator of each text is noted. Mikeal Rogers maintains this manual and is translating the root text. His teacher M. C. Owens is the translator of many of the referential works.

## Introduction

Buddhism has been studying this mind much longer than any other discipline. It has developed a vast array of practices and teachings that are the root of what is now commonly called "meditation" and "mindfulness" which are studied and practiced in various forms.

The size of the buddhist canon, the number of texts and practice traditions from around the globe, all iterating upon prior works, can be overwhelming. The root text of this manual is a 6th century work of chinese buddhism that draws from earlier indic texts and practices that had already been translated into chinese. A great master solving the same problem we have today, being overwhelmened by the vastness of the canon, already produced this work to bring it all together into a single scroll so that chinese buddhists of his time could use for practice and reference.

Many of the practices and teachings referenced in this manual are not commonly known or practiced by modern meditators. I've included, and will continue to expand, translations of other works to illuminate the root text.

Modern meditators often push aside classical buddhist canon as too difficult or esoteric, turning instead to step-by-step instruction guides and "scientific study" by modern authors. Classical buddhist canon remains the root of all the "studied" and "instructed" practices, they contain wisdom that produces and understands such practice forms. Why "study" mere forms of practice while pushing aside the means to understand them directly? Why not discover new practice forms, not yet studyable, derived from such wisdom? What is it one hopes to gain from such exclusive "study?"

This manual arranges selected classical buddhist canon for modern practice. It is a manual for practice, not a manual for "study." It is meant to be read and used during practice. This should be for the meditator not unlike the car manual to the mechanic.

The older a text the less complex the language. Less language complexity means less need for explanatory translation and commentary. Just read and understand it directly. The more you practice with it, the more you will realize it directly.

Modern translations of classical buddhist canon often add complexity to the language. They consider it necessary to include their perceived context and setting for such language, steering such language away from the universal and often rather common and simple original language.

You won't see many words from me in this manual. Buddhist works speak for themselves, best to step aside and let them speak. As commentary I've included translations of other works that illuminate the root text, mostly sutras. The arrangement of the texts along with index tables and links that aid in the use of these teachings are my primary addition.

## "A Manual"

This is a manual I compile in the course of practice and share with all beings. All translations are under development and updated frequently.

It is optimized for accessibility as an ebook for display on eInk devices. I've found these devices best for reading during practice and will include a supplemental section about it in due time.

It can also be downloaded as an ebook for free and viewed on any device with a screen online or offline, and there's a web version that is also accessible if one wishes to send a link to someone directly about a teaching.

The book and site are built from markdown files [maintained on GitHub](https://github.com/mikeal/mind). Any questions, concerns, comments or corrections you can direct to [that repository](https://github.com/mikeal/mind). You can also use the markdown files directly for AI prompts if you wish, as markdown is the unoffical prompt engineering language.
