# mind - A Manual

This is a manual about this mind named "mind."

The root of this manual is a translation of "Six Subtle Dharma Doors," a classic buddhist mediation manual by the great master 智顗 (Zhìyǐ).

Also included are numerous translations of other works, some partial, some complete. Each serves as explanatory commentary on the root text, which is brief in its mention of classic buddhist teachings from which the reader has no point of reference.

The translator of each text is noted. Mikeal Rogers maintains this manual and is translating the root text. His teacher M. C. Owens is the translator for many of the referential works.

## Introduction

Buddhism has been studying this mind much longer than any other discipline. Masters of these teachings are easily recognized, as one can always see what one desires and we all desire liberation of one form or another.

Mastery of practice and knowledge are unseparated.

Beyond both practice and knowledge is wisdom, which is also unseparated.

Thinking we can obtain what is desired in a form of practice we will forsake wisdom for the sake of "realization."

Thinking we can obtain wisdom in the form of knowledge we forsake practice that realizes such wisdom.

Already understanding all dharmas as originally unseparated, one forsakes nothing.

One practices in practicing nothing.

One learns by knowing nothing.

The master appears to be meditating,

Appears to be practicing,

Appears to be reading and writing,

Appears unseparated from no-thing.

### A Manual

This is a manual I compile in the course of practice and share with all beings.

It is optimized for accessibility as an ebook for display eInk devices. I've found these devices best for reading during practice and will include a supplemental section about it in due time.

It can also be downloaded as an ebook for free on any device with a screen and there's a web version that is also accessible.

The book and site are built from markdown files maintained you can find on GitHub. Any questions, concerns, comments or corrections you can direct to that repository. You can also use the markdown files directly for AI prompts if you wish, as markdown is the unoffical prompt engineering language.
